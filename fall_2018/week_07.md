## Last Week's Accomplishments
> Because of the Thanksgiving, I didn't get much things done last week.(I went to Florida for the Disney world there, the firework show was fantastic but there were just so many people :) )

## This Week's Plan

> Considering that the website is pretty much in a good shape, I will help fixing bugs next week if we have any.

## Anything Blocking?

> Multi test this week
## Notes

> This is an optional section for any sort of information that does not fall under any of the other categories.
