## Last Week's Accomplishments
> We struggled on what our goal is and how our project should be developed and we clearly need to rediscuss this topic during our meeting in the weekend.
I missed the meeting last week so I need to catch up a little bit.

## This Week's Plan

> My teammates decide to use CSS and PUG for our development, in which I have little experience. So I need to spend time learning that.

## Anything Blocking?

> I have two exams this week and one next wee, but I will try me best to spend time on the project.

## Notes

> This is an optional section for any sort of information that does not fall under any of the other categories.
