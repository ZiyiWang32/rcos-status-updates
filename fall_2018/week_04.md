## Last Week's Accomplishments
> I finally puhsed something! I added a footer on the main page of our web, which is a link to another page called about. In that page, I added some introduction of our web and the group member.

## This Week's Plan

> I still need to beutify the about page because it looks messy now. I will probably dig into css to accomplish that goal

## Anything Blocking?

> For some unknown reason, I couldn't compile not because of bugs, but because of "Mango connection" problem. I didn't change anything but it just happened. I will try to figue out why

## Notes

> This is an optional section for any sort of information that does not fall under any of the other categories.
