## Last Week's Accomplishments
> I attended the Saturday meeting, where we discussed the algorithm for how we can sperate the assignments put by the users. Also for ways to encourage the users to complete assignments on time, I proposed that we should compare their performance with themselves instead of directly with others.

## This Week's Plan

> I will continue try to catch up with where we are now.(When I stop working the week before, there was only a bases for the website, but now it is a very fantastic web. There are a lot of things to catch up with).

## Anything Blocking?

> FOCS test this week
## Notes

> This is an optional section for any sort of information that does not fall under any of the other categories.
